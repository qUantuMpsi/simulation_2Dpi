# simulation_2Dpi

This code finds the simulated data for Pr(as,ai). With the help of integration functions from scipy namely dblquad() function we are calculating double integral, and finding the value of Pr(as,ai) for each value of as and ai.

Required packages:
1) scipy
2) numpy
3) matplotlib

Note: the parameters are chosen such that we have well observed function within 31x31 matrix.
